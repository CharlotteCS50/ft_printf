	ft_printf

## Introduction

ft_printf was one of the first projects to be carried out at 42. The aim is to re-code the printf function in order to understand how it works. In future projects, the use of printf is forbidden, but we can use our own ft_printf function.

At 42 School, almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), the school's coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.

- [x] `%u` - Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number;
- [x] `%x` - Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format;
- [x] `%X` - Print a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format;
